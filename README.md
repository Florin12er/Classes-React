# React classes based components:

## there are 2 types of components functional and class based
## basically JAVASCRIPT classes

## just like normal components classes can have props and HTML code

## It can have private state (private function that can only be used in that classs)
## functional components don't have the *this* keyword but class based ones and the const one have it.

## Use functional components as much as possible only use class based components if you need them

## Functional components are used mostly do display static text in a page while class based components utilize more state.

## Class based components are more complicated than functional ones.
